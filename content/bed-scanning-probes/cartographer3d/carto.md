# Cartographer3D for Qidi Plus 4

**Heads up - This is still a work in progress. Here (might) be dragons üê≤**

**Everything is functional but not tested yet by multiple users (yet). Consider this an Alpha / Beta. It is not aimed towards notice users. It requires, SSH access, changing Klipper files and updating configs and macros. If you don't understand this, you risk damaging your printer. Performing this mod may limit your ability to update to latest firmware from Qidi. Do not update without checking as it may overwrite important configs.**

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not contact Qidi support about issues with bed leveling, first layer issues, klipper, etc after making this mod. It's now your responsibility. ‚ö†Ô∏è

This guide covers installing Cartographer3D on your Qidi Plus 4. Beacon guide is in the works and should be a mostly similar process.

## Hardware

You of course need a [Cartographer3D probe](https://cartographer3d.com/). USB version. Flat pack will be the most compatible version, since you can assemble it into any configuration. 

This guide is not mount specific, only to say you need a mount for the probe. A list of tested mounts are:

- [Cartographer3D Mount for Qidi Plus 4 by Spooknik](https://www.printables.com/model/1154767-cartographer3d-mount-for-qidi-plus-4)

You should note the X and Y offset of the center of the coil to the center of the nozzle. That will be needed later.

You must be certain the coil is between 2.6 to 3.0 mm from the nozzle tip.

## Software

A small note: The code with "+" and "-" before them are meant to indicate what is added and what is removed. When you copy and paste them onto your machine, please remove the "+" before any line, and delete the lines with "-" before them. 

### Cartographer for Klipper

Cartographer needs a plugin for Klipper to work, this plugin is only supported on Python 3.9 or higher. The Qidi Plus 4 ships with Python 3.7 by default, we need to download Python 3.12 and remake the Klipper virtual environment. 

First download and extract precompiled Python 3.12.3

```bash
sudo service klipper stop

cd ~

wget https://github.com/stew675/ShakeTune_For_Qidi/releases/download/v1.0.0/python-3-12-3.tgz

tar xvzf python-3-12-3.tgz

rm python-3-12-3.tgz
```
Now Python 3.12.3 is in the home directory. We will delete the Klipper virtual enviroment and recreate it. Don't worry this will not touch any of your user data, but you will need to reinstall any klipper plugins after this. 

```bash
rm -rf klippy-env

~/python-3.12.3/bin/python3.12 -m venv klippy-env

cd ~/klippy-env

sed -i 's/greenlet==2.0.2/greenlet==3.0.3/' ../klipper/scripts/klippy-requirements.txt # Need to upgrade this package for 3.12.

bin/pip install -r ../klipper/scripts/klippy-requirements.txt
```

Now Klipper installed again using Python 3.12. Now we can install Cartographer.

```bash
cd ~

git clone https://github.com/Cartographer3D/cartographer-klipper.git

./cartographer-klipper/install.sh
```

The plugin is now installed. And we can start up Klipper again

```bash
sudo service klipper start
```

### Patching Klipper

Qidi's version of Klipper has a heavily modified version of `probe.py` and will not work with Cartographer for Klipper, we need to replace this file with vanilla Klipper's  `probe.py`.

```bash
sudo service klipper stop

mv ~/klipper/klippy/extras/probe.py probe.py.bak

wget -P ~/klipper/klippy/extras https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Klipper3d/klipper/refs/heads/master/klippy/extras/probe.py
```

Run `ls ~/klipper/klippy/extras | grep probe` you should have `probe.py` and `probe.py.bak` in `klippy/extras`

Restart Klipper

```bash
sudo service klipper restart
```

### Klipper Configs

#### printer.cfg

We need to modify `[Z_stepper]` with the following:

```diff
[stepper_z]
step_pin:U_1:PB1
dir_pin:U_1:PB6
enable_pin:!U_1:PB0
microsteps: 16
rotation_distance: 4
full_steps_per_rotation: 200
endstop_pin:probe:z_virtual_endstop # U_1:PC3 for Z-max
endstop_pin_reverse:tmc2209_stepper_z:virtual_endstop
- position_endstop:1
position_endstop_reverse:285
position_max:285
position_min: -4
homing_speed: 10
homing_speed_reverse: 10
second_homing_speed: 5
+ homing_retract_dist: 0
homing_positive_dir:false
homing_positive_dir_reverse:true
#step_pulse_duration:0.0000001
```

Comment out (or delete) all the lines in the following sections:

```gcode
#[z_tilt]
#z_positions:
#    -17.5,138.5
#    335.7,138.5

#probe_count:9,9

#mesh_pps: 2,2
```

### gcode_macro.cfg

We need to change what the printer does at the start of the print to not use the stock Qidi probes and use Carto instead.

```diff
[gcode_macro PRINT_START]
gcode:
    AUTOTUNE_SHAPERS

    {% set bedtemp = params.BED|int %}
    {% set hotendtemp = params.HOTEND|int %}
    {% set chambertemp = params.CHAMBER|default(0)|int %}
    M104 S0

    G0 Z50 F600
    G0 X5 Y5  F6000
    {% if chambertemp == 0 %}
        M106 P3 S255
    {% endif %}
    M109 S{hotendtemp}
    M141 S{chambertemp}  
    M204 S10000
    SET_PRINT_STATS_INFO CURRENT_LAYER=1
    ENABLE_ALL_SENSOR
    save_last_file
```

We need to change the homing overrides so the Z axis homes correctly

```diff 
[homing_override]
axes:xyz
gcode: 
    {% set HOME_CUR = 1 %}
    {% set driver_config = printer.configfile.settings['tmc2240 stepper_x'] %}
    {% set RUN_CUR = driver_config.run_current %}
    {% set HOLD_CUR = driver_config.hold_current %}

        SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION Z=-0.1
        G1 Z30 F480
    {% endif %}

    {% if params.X is undefined %}

    {% if params.Z is undefined %}
        SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION X=0

    SET_TMC_CURRENT STEPPER=stepper_y CURRENT={RUN_CUR} 
    M204 S10000
    G90
-   QIDI_PROBE_PIN_2
```

Finally, remove the following lines to prevent the old Z_offset variable from getting saved.

```diff
PRINT_END
[gcode_macro PRINT_END]
gcode:
-    {% if printer.gcode_move.homing_origin.z < 0.5 %}
-       SAVE_VARIABLE VARIABLE=z_offset VALUE={printer.gcode_move.homing_origin.z}
-    {% endif %}
```

```diff
[gcode_macro CANCEL_PRINT]
- save_zoffset
```

#### saved_variables.cfg 

Inside `saved_variables.cfg` we need to set `z_offset = 0.0` as this is now handled by Cartographer.

#### KAMP_settings.cfg

We need to now disable KAMP's adaptive meshing.

In `KAMP_Settings.cfg` (**Not** `KAMP/KAMP_Settings.cfg`) comment out:

`#[include ./KAMP/Adaptive_Meshing.cfg]       # Include to enable adaptive meshing configuration.`

Don't worry adaptive meshing is now handled by Kipper natively in the bed mesh command in the `[print_start]` macro.

#### carto.cfg

Create a new file in your config folder called `carto.cfg`. Copy and paste the contents of [this](./carto.cfg) into the new file.

This file is where we are storing all the changes to printer.cfg that Carto needs to work. You need to modify a few values in this file to get your carto to work for your setup.

#### [mcu scanner]

#### USB Serial

`serial: /dev/serial/by-id/[your carto here]`

Find this by running `ls /dev/serial/by-id/*` in SSH. It should output something like: `/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Cartographer_614e_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`

#### X Y Offset

These should be provided from the maker of the mount you are using. The distance in X and Y from the center of the coil to the center of the nozzle.

`x_offset: 0  `

`y_offset: 15 `

#### [z_tilt]

Depending on your mount's X and Y offset to the nozzle, you need to update the z tilt points so it measures over the lead screws.

The values below are correct if you are using Spooknik's side mount.

```
points:
    0,171.6 # Adjust based on Y X offset
    255,171.6 # Adjust based on Y X offset
```

#### [bed_mesh]

Similar to z_tilt you need adjust the mesh_min and mesh_max to match your probe's offset. 

The values below are correct if you are using Spooknik's side mount.

```
mesh_min: 22, 45 # Adjust based on Y X offset
mesh_max: 295, 295 # Adjust based on Y X offset
```

#### Finishing up

Now you should have everything set up and you are now ready to follow Cartographer's guide for [calibration](https://docs.cartographer3d.com/cartographer-probe/installation-and-setup/installation/calibration).
