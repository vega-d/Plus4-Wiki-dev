## Belt Adjustment Procedure

This is essentially a mix of the Qidi Max 3, and the Qidi Q1 Pro belt adjustment procedures.

### 1 - Turn the Printer Off

### 2 - Loosen the belt tension clamping bolts

Loosen the 8 belt tension clamping bolts on the rear of the Plus 4.  See the photos below.

About 3 full turns anti-clockwise on each bolt is sufficient to release their clamping pressure.
